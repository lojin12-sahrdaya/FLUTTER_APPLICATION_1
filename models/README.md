Place your trained sign-language model here.

Expected default path used by the translator:
- models/sign_model.h5

Optional:
- Set environment variable SIGN_MODEL_PATH to override the model path.

Notes:
- The current code will fall back to the heuristic model if the file is missing or TensorFlow is not installed.
